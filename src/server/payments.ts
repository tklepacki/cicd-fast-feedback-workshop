 * Payment provider integration.
 *
 * NOTE FOR THE WORKSHOP: this file contains a hardcoded credential on purpose.
 * It is what EXERCISE 06 detects. The token is invented - the `wshop_sk_live_` prefix
 * belongs to no real provider - but it matches the custom rule in `.gitleaks.toml`,
 * so the scanner treats it exactly as it would treat a genuine leaked key.
 *
 * The mistake modelled here is the ordinary one: a key pasted in during a hurried
 * integration, meant to be moved to a secret "later".
